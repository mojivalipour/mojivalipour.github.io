I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo supervised by Ali Ghodsi. I am going to finish the PhD soon and I am looking for the best opportunity possible. If you have an offer, don't hesitate to send me an email.

I have a strong background in Machine Learning, I am a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/ZDYXCK2J">certified Self-Driving Engineer</a>, and I am very much familiar with both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) most recent techniques in the literature. The PhD gave me strong insights as I worked on many different projects and I think I had the chance to learn a lot. Now I am ready to contribute on much larger more impactful projects.

I am a good Enginner with good design skills that can lead any complex projects and can work with any person. I have an entrepreneurial mindset and I am ready to change the world!
