I have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo. During the PhD, Ali Ghodsi was my awesome supervisor which I had the chance to collaborate with him for quite a long time and learn a lot. I am always open to new opportunities. If you have an offer, don't hesitate to send me an email.

I have a strong background in Machine Learning, I am a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/ZDYXCK2J">certified Self-Driving Car Engineer</a>, and I am very much familiar with both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV)'s most recent techniques in the literature. The PhD gave me strong insights as I worked on many different projects and I think I had the chance to learn a lot. Now I am ready to contribute on much larger more impactful projects.

I am a good enginner with good design skills that can lead any complex projects and can work with any person. I have an entrepreneurial mindset and I believe, it's time to change the world!
